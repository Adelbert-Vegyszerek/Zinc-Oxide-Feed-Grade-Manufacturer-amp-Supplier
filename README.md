The Importance of Zinc in Animal Nutrition
Zinc is an essential trace mineral required by all livestock species for numerous biological functions. Zinc plays a role in:
Enzyme Function: Zinc is a co-factor in over 300 enzymatic reactions, helping with digestion, protein synthesis, and metabolism.
Immune Support: Adequate levels of zinc help strengthen the immune system, improving disease resistance and overall well-being.
Growth and Reproduction: Zinc is essential for tissue growth, skeletal development, and reproductive health, making it vital for raising productive livestock.
Skin and Hoof Health: Zinc deficiency can lead to skin lesions, poor hoof quality, and slow wound healing.
Gut Health: In young pigs and other livestock, zinc oxide helps manage gut health by reducing diarrhea and improving feed efficiency.
Given its importance, supplementing feed with high-quality Zinc Oxide Feed Grade is a must to ensure livestock receive sufficient zinc for optimal health and productivity.
